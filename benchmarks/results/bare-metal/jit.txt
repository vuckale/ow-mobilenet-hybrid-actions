==> Cold Start Test (single run)
This test measures the time it takes to start and run each binary once. It reflects performance in short-lived, CLI-style or serverless use cases.
==> Measuring Native cold start...
Run 1: 0.57s
Run 2: 0.59s
Run 3: 0.56s
Run 4: 0.51s
Run 5: 0.50s
Average Native cold start time: .546s

==> Measuring WASM (wasmtime) cold start...
Run 1: 1.86s
Run 2: 1.51s
Run 3: 1.57s
Run 4: 1.58s
Run 5: 1.60s
Average WASM (wasmtime) cold start time: 1.624s

==> Measuring WASM (wasmer) cold start...
Run 1: 1.58s
Run 2: 1.53s
Run 3: 1.71s
Run 4: 1.55s
Run 5: 1.75s
Average WASM (wasmer) cold start time: 1.624s


==> Warm Loop Test (100 runs in a single shell)
This test runs each binary 100 times in a loop within a single shell process. It highlights throughput and JIT warm-up behavior.
-- Native 
   real 0m51,717s
   user 0m40,142s
   sys  0m11,568s
-- WASM (wasmtime) 
   real 2m16,046s
   user 1m48,614s
   sys  0m24,159s
-- WASM (wasmer) 
   real 1m32,654s
   user 1m13,559s
   sys  0m19,606s

==> Memory Usage (Maximum Resident Set Size)
This test measures the peak memory usage (Maximum Resident Set Size) for each binary during a single run.
-- Native:
        Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 92268
-- WASM (wasmtime):
        Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 144932
-- WASM (wasmer):
        Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 225076

==> Binary Sizes (in bytes)
This test compares the actual on-disk size of the native binary and the WASM binary.
Native: ../bin/mobilenet-oc-l = 29846032 bytes
WASM (wasmtime/wasmer): ../bin/mobilenet-oc-l-o.wasm = 28410861 bytes

==> Throughput Test (wall time for 100 runs)
This test measures how many runs per second each binary can handle, based on the wall clock time for 100 full executions.
-- Native:
  100 runs in 35 seconds => 2.85 runs/sec
-- WASM (wasmtime):
  100 runs in 128 seconds => .78 runs/sec
-- WASM (wasmer):
  100 runs in 126 seconds => .79 runs/sec
